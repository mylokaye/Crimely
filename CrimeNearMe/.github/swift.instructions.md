# GitHub Copilot Instructions

These instructions define how GitHub Copilot should assist with this project. The goal is to ensure consistent, high-quality code generation aligned with our conventions, stack, and best practices.

## üß† Context

- **Project Type**: iOS App 
- **Language**: Swift
- **Framework / Libraries**: SwiftUI / UIKit 
- **Architecture**: MVVM / Clean Architecture
- **Minimum iOS version: iOS 18+
- **
- **


## üîß General Guidelines

- Use idiomatic Swift conventions (camelCase, struct over class when possible).
- Prefer `let` over `var` for immutability.
- Use Swift‚Äôs optionals and `guard`/`if let` for safe unwrapping.
- Avoid force unwraps (`!`) unless absolutely safe and justified.
- Format using `swift-format` or SwiftLint.
- Document public methods and types using `///` doc comments.
- Leverage value types (structs, enums) and protocol-oriented design.
- Always add comments explaining code features and changes, especially where intent or logic might not be obvious.

## Design and user experience

* Follow Apple‚Äôs Human Interface Guidelines (HIG) as the foundation for all UI and UX decisions.
* Prioritise platform-native behaviours: navigation bars, tab bars, modal presentation, and gestures should match iOS conventions.
* Support Dynamic Type, Dark Mode, and system-wide accessibility settings (reduce motion, bold text).
* Colours and typography: base on system defaults (SF Symbols, SF Pro fonts, system colours) unless a brand override is explicitly documented.
* Interaction: avoid reinventing controls where native ones exist. Custom components must justify their existence and still feel native.
* Add Code to be able to view each view in Xcode canvas. 


## üìÅ File Structure

Use this structure as a guide when creating or updating files:

```text
Sources/
  App/
    Models/
    Views/
    ViewModels/
    Services/
    Utilities/
    Extensions/
Tests/
  Unit/
  Integration/
Resources/
```

## üß∂ Patterns

### ‚úÖ Patterns to Follow

- Use MVVM for SwiftUI-based UIs.
- Use property wrappers like `@State`, `@ObservedObject`, and `@EnvironmentObject` properly.
- Leverage Combine or async/await for reactive and asynchronous logic.
- Use dependency injection through initializers or protocols.
- Break down views into reusable components.
- Validate user input using model or view model logic.
- Use enums with associated values to manage screen/view state.
- Prefer Swift‚Äôs `Codable` for JSON encoding/decoding.

### üö´ Patterns to Avoid

- Don‚Äôt use force unwraps (`!`) unless you‚Äôre certain the value is non-nil.
- Avoid putting business logic directly inside views.
- Don‚Äôt mix UIKit and SwiftUI unnecessarily.
- Avoid deeply nested views or view models‚Äîbreak them into modules.
- Don‚Äôt expose internal state directly‚Äîuse access control (`private`, `internal`, `public`).
- Avoid hardcoding strings or magic numbers‚Äîuse constants or localization.

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

- Use `XCTest` for unit and UI tests.
- Use `@testable import` to access internal modules when needed.
- Write snapshot/UI tests for reusable views or complex components.
- Use mock services conforming to protocols for ViewModel tests.
- Test async behavior using `XCTestExpectation` or `async/await`.

## Guardrails for Copilot

* Do not introduce new third-party dependencies without explicit approval.
* Do not reference unavailable APIs for the declared minimum iOS version.
* Do not fabricate endpoints, keys, or entitlements. If unknown, ask.
* Do not weaken security or privacy to ‚Äúmake it work.‚Äù
* Do not add analytics in tests or preview providers.

## üîÅ Iteration & Review

- Review Copilot output for proper Swift idioms and memory safety.
- Refactor large or nested SwiftUI views into reusable components.
- Use Xcode warnings and SwiftLint to catch violations.
- Guide Copilot with comments for complex UI layout or async logic.
